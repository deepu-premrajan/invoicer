# Goal

The main reason I decided to build this invoicing app is because I needed a
simple tool to create detailed invoices that both myself and the client could
access easily. I sent multiple invoices every month to various clients, so I
figured it would be a nice application to create to better increase my workflow.
Though the invoices I send are simple (hourly rate x hours worked) and there
aren't any complex features to keep in mind, I do plan to incorporate a few more
functions that allow better user flow and application.

## Functionality

-Able to create an invoice by simply filling in form fields. -Can download the
invoice as a PDF. -Can print the invoice. -Can send the invoice to client's
email directly from site.
